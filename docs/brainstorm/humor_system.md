# Humor System

## Introduction

This system is based on the classical theory of the **four humors**, an ancient medical and philosophical framework that describes the fundamental components of living beings. Each humor is associated with specific qualities and elemental properties:

### The Four Humors

1. **Blood** (Air/Hot & Moist)
   - Represents vitality, passion, charisma, and life force
   - Associated with warmth, movement, and sociability
   - Governs speed, charm, and the capacity for connection

2. **Yellow Bile** (Fire/Hot & Dry)
   - Represents aggression, transformation, and raw energy
   - Associated with heat, combustion, and violent change
   - Governs rage, physical power, and destructive force

3. **Black Bile** (Earth/Cold & Dry)
   - Represents solidity, melancholy, and material weight
   - Associated with earth, stability, and permanence
   - Governs physical density, endurance, and grounding

4. **Phlegm** (Water/Cold & Moist)
   - Represents calmness, fluidity, and adaptability
   - Associated with water, flow, and emotional detachment
   - Governs resilience, flexibility, and connection to aquatic realms

### The Void Component

In addition to the four classical humors, this system introduces a fifth element: **the Void**. Unlike the humors, which always sum to 100% and represent a creature's physical and emotional composition, the Void operates independently as a **supernatural multiplier** or **reality anchor**.

The Void percentage determines how tethered a creature is to the physical world:

- **Low Void (0-25%)**: The creature is heavily material, bound by physical laws, dense and tangible
- **Medium Void (25-50%)**: The creature exists in both worlds, with increasing supernatural properties
- **High Void (50-75%)**: The creature is more spirit than matter, with significant ethereal abilities
- **Very High Void (75-100%)**: The creature is barely tethered to reality, nearly pure spirit

## The System

In this system, the four humors always add up to **100%** (representing the physical/emotional makeup), while the **Void %** acts as a "Supernatural Multiplier" or a "Reality Anchor."

- **Low Void (0-10%)**: The creature is hyper-physical, heavy, and bound by the laws of physics.
- **High Void (70-90%)**: The creature is "thin," phasing through walls, resistant to physical weapons, but vulnerable to spiritual attacks.

Here are the revised recipes for your RPG Bestiary:

## 🧪 The Revised Alchemical Bestiary

### 1. The Animated Skeleton (Universal)

- **Humors**: Black Bile 80% | Yellow Bile 20% | Blood 0% | Phlegm 0%
- **Void**: **35%**
- **Logic**: Dominated by **Black Bile** (Earth), representing pure bone and material structure. The **Yellow Bile** provides the animating "spark" of necromantic energy that moves the bones. With **35% Void**, they exist in a liminal state—not quite alive, not quite spirit. They have no Blood (no life force) and no Phlegm (no fluids), making them immune to bleeding, poison, and drowning. Their moderate Void allows them to be commanded by necromancers and bound to the physical world, yet remain partially supernatural. They are the perfect servants: material enough to interact with the world, ethereal enough to be controlled by magic.

### 2. The Vampire (European)

- **Humors**: Blood 60% | Black Bile 30% | Phlegm 10% | Yellow Bile 0%
- **Void**: **40%**
- **Logic**: High **Blood** keeps them charismatic and fast, but the **Void** makes them "partially not there," allowing for mist-transformation. They drink blood to lower their Void when it gets too high, preventing them from drifting into the spirit world (and disappearing).

### 3. The Werewolf (European)

- **Humors**: Yellow Bile 70% | Blood 20% | Black Bile 10% | Phlegm 0%
- **Void**: **5%**
- **Logic**: Almost no Void. They are brutally, painfully material. The overwhelming **Yellow Bile** (Fire) causes the physical body to warp and stretch in a violent "combustion" of flesh.

### 4. The Wendigo (Algonquian)

- **Humors**: Phlegm 50% | Black Bile 50% | Blood 0% | Yellow Bile 0%
- **Void**: **85%**
- **Logic**: A terrifying mix. They have no "warm" humors. With **85% Void**, they are nearly invisible spirits of famine. They are so untethered from reality that they can run on treetops and outpace the wind.

### 5. The Golem (Jewish)

- **Humors**: Black Bile 100% | Others 0%
- **Void**: **2%**
- **Logic**: The ultimate material. At 2% Void, they are basically a sentient boulder. They are immune to almost all spiritual effects because there is simply no "space" in their soul for the spirit world to take hold.

### 6. The Kappa (Japanese)

- **Humors**: Phlegm 80% | Yellow Bile 10% | Black Bile 10% | Blood 0%
- **Void**: **15%**
- **Logic**: Heavily **Phlegmatic** (water-based). Their low Void keeps them bound to their ponds. If the water in their head-bowl (their physical anchor) spills, their Void spikes to 100%, and they "evaporate" back to the spirit realm.

### 7. Baba Yaga (Slavic)

- **Humors**: Black Bile 40% | Yellow Bile 40% | Blood 10% | Phlegm 10%
- **Void**: **60%**
- **Logic**: A high-level master. She maintains a high Void to live in her pocket-dimension (the hut), but uses **Yellow/Black Bile** to remain a terrifyingly physical threat to those who enter her woods.

### 8. The Chupacabra (Latin American)

- **Humors**: Yellow Bile 50% | Blood 30% | Black Bile 20% | Phlegm 0%
- **Void**: **10%**
- **Logic**: Like the Werewolf, it is a creature of "Heat" and "Dryness." It is a physical predator that exists purely in the material hunt.

### 9. The Banshee (Irish)

- **Humors**: Phlegm 90% | Blood 10% | Others 0%
- **Void**: **95%**
- **Logic**: The "Ascension" is almost complete. She is 95% Void, meaning she is barely a ripple in the air. She can't touch the physical world, so she uses her **Blood (Air/Voice)** humor to kill via sound.

### 🌑 New Cultural Addition: The Ghoul (Arabian Myth)

- **Humors**: Black Bile 70% | Yellow Bile 30% | Others 0%
- **Void**: **25%**
- **Logic**: A desert scavenger. The **Black Bile** gives them the "Earthy" hunger for corpses, while the **Yellow Bile** provides the heat to survive the sun and the desert wastes.

### 🎲 RPG Mechanic Idea: "The Void Threshold"

When a player's **Void** rises:

- **Void 25%**: Can see ghosts.
- **Void 50%**: Can walk through thin walls (DC check). Physical damage dealt is reduced by 25%.
- **Void 75%**: Physical weapons pass through the player, but the player can no longer pick up physical objects.
- **Void 100%**: Character is retired (Ascended or Lost).
